      "tion virtualization because I will come back to this once I explained Holograms and volumetric media delivery then I will also Explain how virtual Network functions can be of interest so if we consider a home environments then there are multiple devices and in your home and typically there is a home Gateway. And on the home K3, we have different functionality. There is the HTTP server. There is an entity router firewall also quality of experience monitoring software for instance. if we have TV streams or video streams that we display on screens inside your home then we also monitor the quality of experience inside the home Gateway. And then typical Auto device is a setup box. so stb. Which contains? for a digital TV storage so that you can record movies and TV programs. Middleware that allows you to interact through remote control. And to start recording stop recording play a certain TV program. and so on for unless we need to middleware on the setup box. And also we have a streaming client. So this is the software that starts streaming the files and make sure that we can see the videos on the screen. so if you look at these functionalities on the home Gateway and Books, these are typically called Network functions. And when they are executed on these boxes Then they are executed inside your homes. but if we virtualize them so virtualized Network functions vnfs then They will be. executed not in your home, but in a remote Data Center. and the data center can be close by but can also be far away and another country, but then we software rise this this functions and and they run as software components inside remote Data Center. And this is a very important Evolution because then we don't need these devices in your home. You just need to connect the different screens. to the network sockets so that they have internet connectivity, but but all the other functions that are listed here. They are no longer executed inside your home. and there are many advantages first from point of view of a network operator. Because we can maximize resource utilization. and also optimize energy usage because if all the functions they run on separate devices in each home. They need to run permanently. but if if they are in a data center then we can run many of them on on the same machine. making use of virtual machines or containers inside the data center. and also in terms of Updates, this is a very important Advantage when we update Network functions, then we can very fast and easy deploy them. And and configure them. and it's much easier than changing software on a dedicated device at home in a data center. We can overnight quickly and efficiently updates Network functions. And also for the service provider there are many advantages. Which are listed here. so we can dynamically scale Network and Computing and storage resources. based on on service requirements. so we can make use of elasticity properties of cloud computing. and we have a reduced time to market for se\n"

However, based on the context provided, it seems that formatting or prompting engineering is a powerful tool to maximize the capabilities of autocomplete systems like LLMs. One approach mentioned is using demonstrations or chaining thoughts to provide examples for the LLM to learn from. Another technique discussed is editing within a sentence by reshuffling and adding special words to train the model to predict in the middle of a sentence. These methods can enhance the performance of LLMs without compromising their overall capabilities. Additionally, the importance of providing a sufficient number of demonstrations (possibly around 50) to help the LLM understand patterns and examples effectively was highlighted.
